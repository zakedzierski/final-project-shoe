<p class="lauraprofile"> Laura: Laura Durkin is a PROUD Catholic woman. She lives in the suburbs but we love her anyways. She is an avid runner. While she was in Girls Who Code she developed a coffee addiction. Laura has many siblings whom she loves most dearly. Being around Laura is a bit much sometimes. Laura vibes a lot, especially at Lollapalooza. Sometimes Laura likes to eat eggs in her salad and sometimes she does not. Laura loves sitting across from Zoe. She also is the only one of her siblings who is not a water polo state champion. Its fine though.
